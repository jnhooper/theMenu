# The menu
This is a static site that manages a "menu" for your family using just localstorage. The idea being that if something is not on "The Menu"
then we can't have it. This so far works well to manage toddler expectations. 

Using localstorage means if you get a new phone or use another device it will not remember anything you save.
Eventually we'll add a real backend but this was made in a weekend to appease a 3 year old so... Yea just some quick stuff. 

## how to use
navigate to https://jnhooper.github.io/theMenu/admin and add some menu options for breakfast/movies
whatever you add will immediately show up in the menu. Because it can be annoying to add all the info
there is a show/hide button to toggle visibility. 

keep in mind there is no direct link to admin. this is intentional so that kids dont accidentially see the man
behind the curtain.
